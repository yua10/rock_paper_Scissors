### Problem Statement

The management team of the Hive group of secondary schools has noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects over the last two years. They would like to try and reverse this trend and have asked an external team to come up with a solution that places student enjoyment at the heart of the learning experience.

### Background Research

**Chief Executive Officer, Hive Foundation**

_”Whilst we understand that a comprehensive grasp of STEM subjects is increasingly important within a rapidly technologising society, we also believe all students need a well-rounded, holistic education so that they are able to explore subjects with confidence, retain key knowledge, and obtain high level skills such as critical thinking.”_

**Students**

_”Sometimes certain subjects rely on textbook work too much and this means that the lessons can feel the same.”_

_“I love learning about different topics but it feels like we have so many things to cover that I struggle to remember it all.”_

_“Lessons can often feel the same with teachers using the same activities repeatedly.”_

**Parents**

_”It’s hard to know what to focus on as a parent. Students seem to be overwhelmed with content and this leads to a lack of enjoyment.”_

_“It feels like a lot of fun is missing from the curriculum at the moment, my child used to love school but this seems to be changing.”_

**Teachers**

_“As things stand, a greater focus on STEM subjects has meant that there is less time available for us to spend on non-core subjects in particular. A result of this is that knowledge that students gain is often superficial and lacks depth.”_

_“With the frequency of lessons decreasing, one of the things that we are increasingly noticing is that students are struggling to retain the knowledge that they need.”_

**Department for Education Guidance**

See current guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4#language-and-literacy) (section 7.1).

### Technical Guidelines

- Use version control & work in an Agile manner!
- Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- Your repos should be hosted on Github and your team should utilise it to collaborate with each other. Please refer to the [Git/Github flow document](https://github.com/LaFosseAcademy/discovery-student-repos/blob/main/week-1/version-control/git-notes/git-flow.md) to help with your process
- Your work should make good use of the concepts we have covered so far on the course such as wireframes, working methodologies, architectural thinking, logical reasoning, and authorisation principles.
- Your MVP should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express API, Node, SQL and version control tools.
- You must utilise a database.
- Your project will need a frontend and a backend connected to the database.
- A signup/login system should be implemented.
- Your app should be deployed and you should aim for test coverage of at least 60%.

### Supporting end-user documentation 

- Make sure to create a project `README` for both the backend & frontend
- Examples to consider including in your READMEs but are not limited to:
    - Style guide
    - API documentation
    - Getting Started guide

### Presentation Requirements

- Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics *(this is the order we'd like you to follow)*:
    - Meet the Team (include photos) 
    - Purpose of Solution
    - Planning & Delivery (trello board, wireframes, ERD, stakeholder analysis..)
    - Live Demonstration: you will need to make a screen recording of your product UI and one person from your team will be talking over the recording during the presentation 
    - Technologies
    - Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
    - Test Coverage
    - Challenges and Solutions
    - Future Features
    - What We've Learned

- There will be a 5 minute opportunity for Q&A after each presentation.

_Each team will have:_

<table>
<tr>

<td><details>
<summary><i>A daily stand-up (except weekend)</i></summary>

- Times selected from trainer-provided options.
- Teams commit to:
    - holding stand-up at the same time each day of the project.
    - clearly communicating any absolutely essential absence from stand-up to all team members & trainers.
- Checkout [Agile's guide to daily stand-ups](https://agility.im/frequent-agile-question/what-is-a-daily-stand-up/) for a refresher/inspiration on how to run an effective stand-up.

<summary><i>Retro</i></summary>

- Times will be assigned by trainers but will take place on the Friday morning.
- At least one of your trainers will attend to facilitate.
- One member of the team (if there's a project mananger, then the project manager) will need to download and create a copy of this [file](https://lafosseassociatesltd-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/emile_sherrott_lafosse_com/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B0251DD7E-6465-4E5C-903A-F4EFBCDC2A78%7D&file=Sailboat%20Retrospective.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&wdOrigin=SEARCHENGINE.GOOGLE%2CAPPHOME-WEB.FILEBROWSER.RECENT&wdPreviousSession=79713d72-e9f0-450b-a3c9-2fbdcf8f203e&wdPreviousSessionSrc=AppHomeWeb&ct=1747396157831) on the Friday morning.
- Then edit to add the teams feedback into the four quadrants. 
- The project manager will need to show this to the trainer for a reflection on the notes.
- **Note: This feedback needs to collected about the dynamic of the team. Individual feedback is mostly discussed in a Sprint Review**
