## UX Design 101

## User Experience
### Overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context

- user experience (UX) as the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context
- we often hear about UX in relation to digital products (for e.g, websites and apps), but isn't limited to the digital space
- anything that can be experienced can be designed
- you experience UX in their everyday life - from the time they wake up till they go to bed, they come across various products like toothbrushes, shampoo bottles, cars, tubes, friges, TV sets, washing machines...

---

## Why should we learn about UX?

- knowing about UX will not only help them make their products and apps more successful but it will also allow them to interact with designers in their real-life job with ease and confidence
- including UX as a step in your app process will speed up the actual development of the app
- ultimately, we're not trying to turn you into UX professionals, but we'd like you to be aware of UX as an important step in developing an app

## UX vs UI design

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192490100-d1b652e1-3b4d-44c4-be50-4c2009331ac9.png">

## UX
### Concerned with creating a simple, useful and delightful experience for the app user 

## UI
### Concerned with the look and feel of an app


- UX stands for user experience and is concerned with creating a simple, useful and delightful experience for the app user whereas UI stands for user interface and is concerned with the look and feel of an app
- if the website were a body, HTML would be the skeleton, CSS would be the skin and JS would be the blood and muscles and organs - all of these are moving parts that allow the body to function
- UX is concerned with the body's behavior, with what it can do whereas UI is concerned with the body's appearance, its flesh, makeup and clothes

- the UX element would be the text field taking some user input, which in turn instantly returns a list of links to relevant websites as well as a brief summary of each site
- the UI element is the fact that the text field is centered on a white page, placed under a colorful logo of Google. Feel free to go more into the specifics of the hight of the text field, the shadow, the border-radius and all other CSS elements of the page

## UX Design in the digital space

#### UX Design in the digital space - what not to do in UX?

- being able to recognize bad UX is an important skill to have that will help them develop good UX interfaces in the future
- "What is bad UX about this feature?"
- Use this following article as a guide: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/10-classic-ux-design-fails/

### Whatsapp delete message feature

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192473835-673c7f77-e2a1-4b2e-af1b-f2e0ae0c3ce5.png">

**Why it’s bad UX:** Informing the recipient that the sender has deleted a message somewhat defeats the purpose of deleting it in the first place. In fact, this looks way more suspicious and is likely to prompt an awkward “why did you delete the message?” type of response

**The key takeaway:** make sure that the function of the feature matches up with the users’ expectations set by the messaging

### Netflix hover autoplay

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192474218-f351d7aa-8502-4e4a-a243-fe09ab341006.png">

**Why it’s bad UX:** Auto-anything means the designers have made huge assumptions about the users’ desires

**The key takeaway:** If a feature gets in the way of a site’s usability or hinders users from seeing key information, it simply shouldn’t be there

### RyanAir booking platform

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192474210-e9cb394f-6d79-4f7c-a85f-9e475386f46c.png">

**Why it’s bad UX:** Dark UX is the opposite of user-first design. Rather than considering the functionality and usability of a platform, dark UX deliberately confuses and misleads users into choosing certain options over others, normally in the interest of generating more revenue for the company

**The key takeaway:** Transparency is key to building a good relationship with your users, and infinitely more valuable than the short-term gratification of your users spending a little more money than they meant to

- whether you're designing a login screen, a search experience or anything else, usability is essential
- there are usability measures that exist to help us understand how usable our products really are - they are called 'heuristics'

---

## Heuristics

### Usability principles for user interface design

#### Narrative
- Don Norman, a design consultant - came up with the word 'heuristics' to refer to these usability measures 
- heuristics are important principles to follow when shaping their designs to make sure their products are more usable to more people and more likely to succeed

### Visibility of System Status

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462363-1e463a26-e333-49c4-b89c-2687ed75f6d8.png">

- An app should always show the status of an on-going operation to the users until is is fully done/processed. This way, users get a clear understanding of the progress of that particular process and activity and are not left confused

---

### Match Between System and Real World

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462356-fca830de-c387-48df-8ebb-d771d60966e9.png">

- user interaction is key is building a successful product. To make that interaction easier between users and product, it's important to use components that are familiar to the end users so that they can relate them with everyday things and understand the purpose of each element

---

### User Control and freedom

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462370-57ef691f-0e05-4880-a435-7ce5aed03f05.png">

#### Definition
- a user needs complete control and freedom over the entire system - meaning the system should enable users to undo an action that happened by mistake
- without user control and freedom, frustrating usability issues can occur leaving users disatisfied

---

### Consistency and Standard

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462347-f90a7227-5840-405a-8c62-6ce8a94afe04.png">

#### Definition
- a rule of thumb is to follow the consistency and standard throughout product design - meaning that all components need to follow a similar branding
- without consistency and standard, users might be left confused if they see different kind of experiences on different task flows

---

### Error Prevention

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192474750-855dfa30-9089-4e9a-a90d-a5d2f72cddf6.png">

#### Definition
- users might make some mistakes, so it's important to prevent those potential mistakes by having appropriate suggestions and notifications when needed 

---

### Recognition Rather than recall

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462368-9464b116-b006-4e39-abcf-ef475854e79d.png">

#### Definition
- minimizing the use of the user's memory is key. Remind users as much as possible to complete a certain task that needs to be done soon and don't let them have to recall their memory to complete tasks

---

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462367-4c4ae787-9cd6-406d-995b-f5f42810a226.png">

#### Definition
- a design should be easy to use for all user groups. You might have novice users and experienced one, so it's important to satisfy all categories

---

### Aesthetic and Minimalist design

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192475332-9bb30d9d-a80b-4a7a-a3c2-6dc64009b7fa.png">

#### Definition
- an aesthetic and minimalist design is all about removing all the clutter on a page and keep the relevant data only
- it's important to grab users attention toward the action needed to be done or give the exact data they want to see to avoid confusion

---

### Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192474754-37188a7f-0d00-4a9e-beb8-916b83a07e7f.png">

#### Definition
- it's important to help users identify what is the exact error they might encounter and suggest a way to get rid of it
- without the appropriate help, users will move away from the product if getting stuck on something

---

### Help and Documentation

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/192462359-d0faffc1-575f-4691-aedf-eece978e10e9.png">

#### Definition
- having a help page makes for a better user experience
- the presence of a user on a help page can indicate that the product is not that intuitive, having help and documentation becomes even more important

#### 5 key phases of UX Design 

  - Product Definition
  - Research
  - Analysis
  - Design
  - Validation

---

## STEP 1 - Product Definition

- this phase is done before anything is created
- before you can build a product you need to fully understand its reason for being
- this phase usually includes:
  - Stakeholder interviews to gather insights and goals
  - Value proposition mapping thinking about who will use it and why they will use it
  - Concept sketching creating early mock-ups of the future product (usually low-fidelity paper sketches)

---

## STEP 2 - Product Research

  - User research - usually through in-depth interviews
  - Market research - to understand industry standards and identify opportunities for the product within a particular niche (this is sometimes called Competitive research)

---

## STEP 3 - Analysis

This is an extension of the previous phase, that moves from "what" users think or want, to "why" they think or want it

This phase often includes:
  - **User personas** - fictional characters that represent the different user types for your product
  - **User stories** - tools that help the designer understand the product or service from the user's point of view. These usually take on the following structure: "As a [user] I want to [goal to achieve] so that [motivation]"
  - **Storyboarding** - essentially a story about a user interacting with your product

---

## STEP 4 - Design

This phase usually includes:
  - **Sketching** - usually done by hand on a piece of paper, this can help you quickly visualise a broad range of design solutions
  - **Wireframing** - helps designers visualise the structure of a future page, acts as the backbone for a product
  - **Prototyping** - prototypes are about the actual interaction experience of the product (the look and feel). Essentially, they are a simulation of the product
  - **Design Specifications and Systems** - contain all of the visual design assets, components, and patterns required for developers to turn prototypes into a working product.

---

## STEP 5 - Validation

This is a vital final phase which focuses on testing out their designs on their potential users

The UX design process is not linear - it is iterative:
  - Ultimately, the more communication and thinking at each stage of the process, the better the end product will be
  - Use what works the best for your project, get rid of the rest, and evolve your UX process as your product evolves

---

## What is User Research

User research as a way to understand the user's needs, behaviors, experience and motivation through various techniques such as observation, interview, surveys etc..

User research can be done in all stages of the product design process - ideation stage to the launch stage

User research is important to uncover useful insights about the target audience and their needs. Without knowing that information,it would be much harder to deliver a great user experience

There are different user research methods out there to use, which are divided in two categories

---

## User Research methods

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25111733/207379836-a230d456-2e21-4568-91ef-c3d7d2b79fcc.jpg">

### Notes:

#### Narrative

The two large groups of UX Research methods:
  - qualitative
  - quantitative

Qualitative methods:

  - **User interviews** – ask users about their experience with a product
  - **Usability testing** – moderated or unmoderated testing of a product by people who represent the target audience
  - **Contextual inquiry** – observing how users interact with a product in their environment
  - **Guerrilla testing** – gathering user feedback by taking a prototype into a public place like a café and asking people for their thoughts
  - **Focus groups** – inviting a small group of people who represent the target audience to discuss their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product

Quantitative methods:
  
  - **Surveys** – questionnaires often gather a large volume of responses which can open up the opportunity for more detailed user analysis
  - **Eye-tracking** – technology that measures eye movements and makes it possible to know where a person is looking, what they are looking at, and for how long their gaze is in a particular spot on a page
  - **Product analytics** – usage data from real users of the product can yield some of the best insights into product development

## What is a user persona? 

User personas are fictional representations of your target customers. As a UX designer, creating user personas involves researching and outlining your ideal customer’s goals, pain points, behaviour, and demographic information.

The research involved in putting together a user persona report will not only help them understand their target audience but will also help them create a better product for users.

User personas are crucial if you want to design something that is useful, desirable, and valuable to your target audience. 

---

## How do you define a user persona? 

A user persona would include things like goals, pain points, behaviour patterns, age, and common problems

These characteristics will determine how you serve these customers in the future, especially when it comes to making marketing decisions. Even small factors like location or salary can influence how those people make decisions, and in turn, use your product

The key pieces of information on the descending slides that make up a well-defined user persona:

|||

| Sections | Explanation |
| --- | --- | 
|Personal background |age, gender, education, family status
|Professional background |professional occupation, income level
|User environment |physical, social, technology context
|Psychographic |uses attitudes, interests, pain points

|||

| Other key infos | Explanation |
|--- | --- |
| Goal(s) | Motivating factors - why are they using your app/what problem are they trying to solve |
| Frustration(s) | What is stopping them from buying your product, or using it more often/better/more expertly? What is the main barrier to achieving their goal? |
