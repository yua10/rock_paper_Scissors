# Hackathon #1: Game Jams 🎮

> **But… what is a Hackathon?**
- Hacking is **creative problem solving**
- A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to **solve problems**
- Don’t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. **Real life problems are hard!** Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to practice your **problem solving skills**

### Duration

This is a whole day hackathon!

### Team setup

Pairs of students/ teams of 3 if odd numbers

### What?

The goal of this hackathon is to **build a CLI game** using your logical reasoning and programming fundamentals skills (JavaScript). If time allows, feel free to build a **frontend** interface for the game as well. 

Before starting active development of your game, make sure to write a set of instructions in **pseudocode** to instruct a computer to play the chosen game. Once you have written your pseudocode, you can start thinking about how it would translate into actual code and start active development of your game. This process will help you conceptualize the creation of your game. 

You will find below a **list of popular games** to choose from, which are categorized by level of difficulty: 

**Easy**

- Rock Paper Scissors ✂️
- Roll a dice 🎲
- Guess a number 🔢

**Medium**

- War of the cards 🃏
- Text-based command-line Adventure Game 🦸

**Hard**

- Tic tac Toe ❌
- Connect 4 🍀
- Memory card game 🎴

### How?

- Google is your friend! If you get stuck on anything, your first resort should be google, then you can ask your peers, and finally come to us if none of the previous solutions helped you
- Make sure to host your project on **GitHub** and send your repository link to your cohort group **by 3pm**
- Your repo should have an informative and structured **README** stating how to run your app and play the game. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- In pairs, make sure to practice **pair programming**. Alternate between being a driver and navigator
    - *Driver -* writes code
    - *Navigator* - reviews each line of code as it is typed in
- **You can also use LiveShare on VS Code to collaborate**

### Guidance

- Take time to brainstorm with your pair and choose the kind of game you’d like to build 🧠
- Talk about how you’d want the coding process to go 🗣️
- Create a Github repository for your project and make your partner a collaborator of the project 📁
- Make sure to take breaks, hydrate and stretch 💧

### Deliverables

- A  **GitHub** link to your code **by 4pm** on your cohort group

**HAVE SOME FUN!** 🕺 💃
