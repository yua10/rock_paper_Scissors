## Scenario Overview: PixelQuest Gaming Studios

PixelQuest Gaming Studios is a medium-sized game development company known for its immersive, story-driven single-player games. Established in 2005, the studio has built a reputation for delivering high-quality gaming experiences. However, PixelQuest is struggling to keep up with the evolving gaming industry and player expectations.

#### Challenges
1. **Player Engagement**: The studio lacks an integrated platform for players to connect, share experiences, and access post-launch content. This has limited community engagement and loyalty compared to competitors who offer interactive apps or web platforms.
2. **Feedback and Analytics**: PixelQuest has no centralised system to gather, analyse, and act on player feedback. Feedback is currently collected via multiple unconnected channels (social media, emails, forums), making it inefficient to track trends or prioritise improvements.
3. **Developer Efficiency**: Internally, the development team uses outdated tools and manual processes for tracking progress, bug reports, and cross-department collaboration, leading to delays and miscommunications.
4. **Monetisation Opportunities**: The studio has no digital storefront for microtransactions, DLCs, or subscriptions. Players must purchase games via third-party platforms, limiting potential revenue streams and personalisation of offers.

To address these challenges, PixelQuest envisions creating a **centralised digital platform** to enhance player experience and operational efficiency.

## Brief

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Potential Solutions
Based on the scenario, brainstorm ideas for digital products that could help PixelQuest achieve the following:
- Build a stronger connection with the player community
- Provide a seamless way to collect and analyse player feedback
- Enhance internal collaboration and efficiency among development teams
- Open up new monetisation channels (e.g., in-app purchases, subscriptions)

Focus your brainstorming on digital solutions like **mobile apps**, **web platforms**, or **cloud-based tools** that address these needs. Document a range of ideas, considering both front-end (user-facing) and back-end (organisational) components.

#### Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis
Conduct a stakeholder analysis for the proposed solutions:
1. Identify key stakeholders 
2. Categorise stakeholders based on their power, interest, and influence using a [stakeholder matrix](https://miro.com/templates/stakeholder-analysis/)
3. Summarise the needs and expectations of each group (e.g., players want a user-friendly interface, developers need automated feedback integration)

#### Part 3: Agile Mini-Project
Using Agile methodology, outline a mini-project for the design and development of one proposed solution. Examples might include a **PixelQuest Companion App** or a **Player Feedback and Analytics Portal**. Your project should include:

1. **Project Vision Statement**:
   - Define the app or web product’s purpose and how it aligns with PixelQuest’s goals
2. **User Stories**:
   - Write [user stories](https://www.easyagile.com/blog/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development/) for key stakeholders, such as:
     - **Players**: “As a player, I want to receive personalised game updates and community events so that I feel connected to PixelQuest.”
     - **Developers**: “As a developer, I want to view consolidated feedback reports in real-time so that I can prioritise improvements.”
3. **Initial Wireframes**:
   - Design a high-fidelity wireframe for the front-end of your proposed solution on Figma
4. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Break down the product into at least 2-3 sprints, specifying key deliverables for each sprint. For example:
     - **Sprint 1**: Develop login and user profile functionality
     - **Sprint 2**: Implement player feedback submission and dashboard
     - **Sprint 3**: Add community forum and game update features     
5. **Backlog Items**:
   - Create a backlog with tasks prioritised by importance and dependency
  
   _**NB** It is not vitally important that you 'correctly' identify each of the tasks that you would need to do in order to, say, develop 'login and user profile functionality' - the task is about getting you to think about Sprints as mini, fairly self-contained pieces of work and what **might** be some of the component parts needed to build that particular aspect of your solution._

#### Part 4: Markdown Documentation
Document your mini-project using Markdown formatting. Include:
- An executive summary of the scenario and proposed solution
- Stakeholder analysis outcomes 
- High-fidelity wireframe
- Agile project plan, including user stories, sprint plans and end goals, and backlog items
- Supporting visuals (e.g., flowcharts, wireframes, task breakdowns, Trello boards for each Sprint)

#### Completed `md` documentation should be posted on the `Bevan Students` channel by 12.30pm - Good luck!
