## BUSINESS ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE

### Notes:
#### Point 
When approaching a problem, we need to think about the wider context surrounding the business, what our objectives and needs are, our key performance indicators, our stakeholder's desires, and our acceptance criteria. All of this ultimately feeds into our Agile methodology and our working patterns. A comprehensive BA can help you understand the structure and dynamics of a company, to identify problems and potential solutions, to identify and articulate the need for change, and to maximise value delivered by an organisation. It can, in short drive organisations forward.

#### Transition
We can divide the BA process into 6 stages - which we'll take a quick look before delving into our working example.

### 1. ASSESS NEEDS
### 2. PLAN BUSINESS ANALYSIS
### 3. ELICIT INFORMATION
### 4. DEVELOP FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
### 5. MONITOR/CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
### 6. EVALUATE SOLUTIONS

### Notes:
#### Point
These are the 6 stages that we're going to go through in the BA life cycle. It's important to note that they're sometimes called different things, but the broad principles of what you're going to learn today are used when exploring and assessing potential solutions to problems that might need to be solved and opportunities that might need to be explored.

#### Highlight
Two key things. 
The first is that good BA is about constantly asking questions and assessing the answers to them.
The second is that the one key thing that we need you to take away from this session is an understanding of stakeholders and how we evaluate their influence on a project. This is something that all of you will incorporate into your final projects and, as such, it's vital you can use this by the end of the session.

#### Transition
Without further ado, let's look at our example.

### Notes:

#### **Send** students the following information:

Founded 7 years ago, we are a mid-size real estate company that has traditionally focussed on sales. We have had a successful start, however have noticed a fall in property sales over the past 12 months. Having seen the trends outlined below we are looking for ways to extend our offering and are beginning to look a the rental market. We are looking to identify pain points in the "finding/keeping a good roommate" journey and to find ways of solving those pain points.

A few trends of note: 54% of the world's population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago) and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with roommates. Finding and keeping a good roommate, however, gets harder as more people head to cities and the market becomes more competitive.

#### Transition
We are going to look at each of the stages of the Business Analysis process through the prism of futurehomes.

## 1. ASSESS NEEDS &#8594;

### Notes:
#### Point 

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Assess current environment and capabilities
2. Define desired environment and capabilities
3. Identify differences/gaps between current and desired states
4. Develop a business case for action

**Think** how might this apply to our case study? 
- The current environment is problematic for sales 
- We need to look for additional revenue streams to support the business model
- Gaps might be a fall in profits or people taking up the organisation's services
- Needs action in order to remain competitive

#### Transition
With that done, we need to plan our analysis.

## 2. PLAN BUSINESS ANALYSIS &#8594;
### Stakeholders <!-- .element: contenteditable="true" -->

### Notes:
#### Point 
Key thing to analyse here are stakeholders.
A stakeholder is a person, group or organisation with a vested interest, or stake, in the decision-making and activities of a business, organisation or project. 
**Ask** whether anyone has experience of working with stakeholders and how this applied to their previous role.
**Alternatively** include your own example here to illustrate this further - particularly to show that stakeholders will have enormously different levels of influence and interest in a given project and that you may want to focus on prioritising the 'satisfaction' of certain stakeholders.

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Analyse stakeholders
2. Assess environmental factors (people, places)
3. Develop plans for business analysis work (scope, techniques)
4. Define various work practices

**Validate** potential stakeholders for futurehomes (e.g. Local councils, People looking for roommate, Estate agents, Banks, Investors, Owner of futurehomes, Local community, Landlords)

#### Transition
Let's look at these stakeholders in more detail...

### Notes:
**Explain** the axis
- Influence
How much influence (power) they have over the project
- Interest
How much interest do they have in the project and/or how much will it impact them

**Explain** the quadrants
- High power / High interest
        likely to be decision makers
        have the biggest impact on the project success
        need to keep these stakeholders close & manage their expectations.
- High power / Low Interest
        need to be kept in the loop with what is happening on the project
        even though they may not be interested in the outcome, they yield power
        dealt with cautiously because they could use their power in a negative way if they become unsatisfied
- Low power / High interest
        keep these people adequately informed
        talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising
        can often be very helpful with the detail of your project 
- Low power / Low interest
        monitor these people, but do not spend time and energy with excessive communication

**Transpose** stakeholders onto grid (annotate on Zoom). For example, Owner would be high influence and moderately high level of interest (would have to keep eye on other aspects of business), People looking would be very high level of interest but prob in 'keep informed' for power of influence)

## 3. ELICIT INFORMATION &#8594;
### Elicitation Techniques <!-- .element: contenteditable="true" -->

### Notes:
#### Point 

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Identify objectives and participants
2. Determine elicitation techniques
3. Develop questions and choose formats

**Gather** different techniques for research. How would we get the information that we need to make decisions?
**Validate** sensible answers.

**Ideas for Extra Responses**
- Descriptive Data Collection: Surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Self-Reports
- Passive Data Collection
- Media Data Collection: Radio, Television, Mobile, etc.

#### Transition
Now that we've gathered the data, we need to look at how we would move on from here...

## 4. DEVELOP FORMAL REQUIREMENTS &#8594;

### Notes:
#### Point 

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Analyse results of elicitation
2. Compare findings to assessed needs
3. Use models to enhance requirement details (computer simulations, developing process flows)
4. Specify and prioritise requirements
5. Ensure requirements align with needs

**Explain** that, by the end of this stage - we should be at a point where we have an understanding of Key performance Indicators, data, stakeholders, and needs. It's here that we prioritise our requirements (come up with our **MVP** (or a version of it) if you will), and ensure that this fits with what we need as a business.

**Ask** so, what are our potential solutions? 

**Split** students into groups and give them 5 minutes to come up with a suggestion for something that futurehomes could do based on what they have heard so far. Stress, that this does not need to be a perfect solution by any means, just something that they feel may address the problems based on what they know about the business.

#### Transition
**Gather** ideas from groups and go to next stage...

---

## 5. MONITOR/CONTROL REQUIREMENTS &#8594;

### Notes:
#### Point 

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Use requirement traceability methods
2. Measure requirements performance
3. Continually verify requirements to match needs
4. Manage changes to requirements

**Explain** that this is, as the name suggests, an ongoing process. The point here is to continually review and to continually monitor progress. Rather like Agile methodology where we 'fail fast, and fail cheap' because we are dividing the work and have clear lines of communication at all times, we need to establish ways of monitoring whether our solutions meet requirements that we have established.

**Explain** that one way of doing this is via a **Requirement Traceability Matrix** which is designed to understand how important each requirement of a particular project is, and also dependencies between requirements, as well as ensuring that the solution being proposed aligns with requirements.

#### Transition
Let's have a look at an example...

## 6. EVALUATE SOLUTIONS

### Notes:
#### Point 

#### Narrative
**Explain** the following:
1. Develop/select key performance indicators
2. Ensure solution matches requirements
3. Verify solution meets underlying needs
4, Ensure solution meets acceptance criteria

**Explain** that this is essentially decision time. There are lots of places that we can look into making effective decision making and I'll send over a useful initial link. Remember though...

**Share** this link with students as a useful summary of data-led decision making:
