# Game Presentation
 
## About the Presentation

This presentation is based on a game that was introduced during the **SE Taster Day** (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
The process of building the game fosters essential skills such as *communication*, *collaboration*, and *teamwork*.
These aspects should be highlighted throughout the presentation.
 
The presentation **should** be created using PowerPoint.
This will help you get accustomed to these tools for larger presentations in the future.
